This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
election = read_csv('../../data/countypres_2000-2020.csv')
county_wise = election %>%
  filter(state == "WISCONSIN" & year == 2016) %>%
  group_by(year, county_name, party) %>%
  summarise(
    votes = sum(candidatevotes)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    percentage = votes/sum(votes)*100
  )

county_wise
```

```{r}
county_wise %>%
  filter(county_name < "DODGE") %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = "", y = percentage, fill = party)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") + 
  coord_polar(theta = "y", start=0) + 
  facet_wrap(~county_name)
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
